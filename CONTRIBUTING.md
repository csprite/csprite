# Contributing
open-source community is what keeps projects like these alive, contributors are really legends doing stuff without asking for any money. if you want to contribute to csprite this page goes into detail how code is styled & structured in csprite.

the best way you can contribute is using csprite and pointing out bugs & lacking features, the more you use csprite the more mature it will become.

## Code Style
there isn't a particular code style for csprite, use whatever you are comfortable with but make sure function/variable names are not too long and avoid snake-case naming style if possible.

global variables usually start with a captial letter, and local variables start with small letter.

---
## Code Structure
each file in [`src`](./src) serves a purpose, if a particular feature has more than 2 files than it should be transferred into it's own directory as done with [`src/ifileio`](./src/ifileio)
