The software currently only supports Linux, with plans for
expanding to Windows & Mac, & Possibly various other operating
systems as well.

You can download pre-built binaries of the software [here](https://github.com/csprite/csprite/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Ac).

The main aim of this software is to be simple, Not only
in code but in terms of UX as well. This is why main
application code resides here, But various functionalities
like support for various file formats will be separated into
plugins.  This ensures that not only compiling the project
will be simpler but the overall foot print of the program
will be smaller as well & Only required things will be loaded.
