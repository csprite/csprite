## Supported Versions

security patches will not be issued for a version already released as a separate patch but if reported it will be patched and released in the next csprite release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

reporting a vulnerability is as easy as mailing it at pegvinaditya@proton.me or [raising a new issue](https://github.com/pegvin/csprite/issues/new/choose)
